# DC/OS 104 - Deployments

Deploying a service involves a couple of decisions incl. when and how the upgrade should take place.
This lab walks you through the basics of health checks (so DC/OS knows when it can kill an old instance of a service)
to different zero-downtime deployment styles including canary deployments and Blue-Green deployments.
